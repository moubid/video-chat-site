#my video chat website#
so we have a video chatting website here
it is based on python/django and java script 
and we used agora for video/voice and live interactive streaming platform
this web app does video chatting with people based on web and if it runs
on server it supports many users.
first of all, you need to write your room name on the room page in the
field, there either is a room or isn't, if there is,it will join the
room and if there isn't, it will make a room.
when you join the room, usually it takes a time to load the pictures,
(you have to give the camera and microphone access to make this happen)
after that,you can see the data that captures by your camera
you can also mute your voice or close your camera
with camera icon you can open/close your picture
with microphone you can open/close your voice
with the V sign you can leave the room.
